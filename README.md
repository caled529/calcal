# CalCal

**Cal**e's **Cal**endar, a calendar app designed by and for me, but you can try
it out too. Written in GO and making heavy use of the 
[Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework and the
[Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) library, I aim to create something on
the level of [Calcurse](https://calcurse.org), but more focused and simplified 
for my own style or organization.
